# Missions and Challenges

Defines daily and weekly mission structures, rewards, and progression incentives.

## Overview

Missions provide structured goals that drive:

- Daily engagement (short gameplay sessions)
- Weekly long-term targets (deeper collection/strategy)
- Cross-mode engagement (battles, boosters, marketplace, enigmas)

## Daily Missions

**Objective:** Create a reason to return every day with low time commitment.

### Core Daily Challenges

Each day, players can complete any of these missions:

1. **Booster Challenge**: Open 2 boosters from the active pack
   - Reward: 30 points + bonus card
   - Engagement: collection loop, pack discovery

2. **Battle Challenge**: Win at least 1 festival battle
   - Reward: 35 points + rare+ card drop chance
   - Engagement: competitive, strategic

3. **Enigma Challenge**: Solve at least 5 enigmas (out of 10 available)
   - Reward: 25 points + card rewards per solved enigma
   - Engagement: knowledge, exploration

4. **Marketplace Challenge**: List, buy, or trade a card
   - Reward: 20 points + bonus marketplace fee discount (e.g., 1% off next transaction)
   - Engagement: economy, social

### Daily Pick

**Description:**

- Offered once per 24-hour window
- 5 face-down card slots from the active pack
- Player selects 1 card to add to collection
- Remaining 4 cards are discarded

**Purpose:**

- Guaranteed daily card reward (separate from booster luck)
- Adds decision-making (which card to pick without seeing details)

**Mechanics:**

- Timing: can be claimed anytime during the day
- Expiration: resets at 00:00 UTC (or per server timezone)
- Cannot be deferred (1 pick per day, not cumulative)

**Payout Considerations:**

- Non-rare weighted (more common/uncommon cards to avoid power creep)
- OR uniform random from active pack (simpler, less predictable)

### Daily Rewards
